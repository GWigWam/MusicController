+ Add 'show song name' command (not in SpeechCommands.cs ?, no access to UI here)
+ Fix: When selecting multiple files on startup only start playing first/last
+ Name XAML objects, rename event handlers in codebehind
+ Make genericly typed RelayCommand / AsyncCommand (apply to FullPlayerViewModel.MovePlaylistSongsCommand
+ Re-organise FullPlayer codebehind, it's a mess
+ Respect drop playlist location when adding files
