# ToDo

+ Add 'show song name' command (not in SpeechCommands.cs ?, no access to UI here)
+ In playlist: Add right-click > open file location
+ On FullPlayer maximize scroll list to current song
+ Previous command: when under 5 sec should reset song to 0, otherwise go 1 song back
+ Some way to clear search, maybe esc?
+ Don't crash when headphones are pulled from pc
