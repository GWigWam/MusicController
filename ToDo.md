# ToDo

+ Add 'show song name' command (not in SpeechCommands.cs ?, no access to UI here)
+ In playlist: Add right-click > open file location
+ Don't crash when headphones are pulled from pc
+ Click & Drag songs in playlist to change order
+ Fix: When selecting multiple files on startup only start playing first/last
